# Sentinel X's website - General Purpose Discord Bot
Hello reader,
If you're here, you are probably interested in the source of my website.
Originally, it was a template from Aria / Inovatik. That can be found [here](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page259/aria)
report broken links, please. Thank you.

## further info [TL;DR]
I wanted a template, because I was still in the process of learning. Likely still am. Optimists found it a cool websites and pessimists only talked me down on my website, as if it's terribly made. Thank you, both. You teach me the difference. Both of you took part of the poll you never knew about. I'm talking about the people who found me "annoying" just because I was the one that complained about them. I complained about their behavior, as I was enthusiastic about telling something, I can't remember what, but that already was "annoying", so they started disliking whatever I made, disliking me, Disliking whoever / whatever around me. That was obviously needed, they thought. Very immature, people. Grow up. Another disappointment in humanity.
